### Dislocation Ontology
This repository shows the development of dislocation ontology and this study is submitted to Second International Workshop On Semantic Digital Twins (SeDiT 2021), June 6th, 2021.

In this work, first steps towards formalizing the knowledge of dislocations together with the relevant details concerning the crystallography are introduced. Emphasis is put on representing the dislocation geometry, utilizing semantic formalization using an ontology. We start by designing and modeling a formal definition of crystalline materials in terms of the underlying crystallography including slip plane and slip direction. The former is the plane to which the motion of the dislocation is generally constrained, the latter is the direction along which plastic deformation takes place. Those should be explicitly described along with the idealization of dislocation as a mathematical line and other required details of crystalline materials.

### Project Structure
* `data`
    * `MaterialProject/Nickel` 
    The Nickel data is collected from [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)
    * Slip system data of FCC Nickel is taken from [the Crystallography and Crystal Defects book](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119961468)
* `CQs` is a folder for storing the collection of the competence questions.
