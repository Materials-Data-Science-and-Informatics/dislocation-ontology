## About DISO
DISO is an ontology that defines the linear defect, in particular dislocation concepts and relations between them in crystalline materials. Moreover, Crystal Structure Ontology (CSO) and Crystallographic Defect Ontology (CDO), which ontologies define the concepts of crystal structureand crystalline defect, respectively, are also introduced in this repository. The ontology development processes are described following the well-known practices, e.g., using ontology metadata and reusing existing  ontologies,  e.g.,  MDO,  EMMO,  and  QUDT. To evaluate DISO, we have gathered competency questions (CQs) that will be answered via SPARQL query.

## Repository Description
* You may find the DISO with various formats: [rdf](/dislocation-ontology.owl), [turtle](/dislocation-ontology.ttl), [json-ld](/dislocation-ontology.jsonld), etc.
* We locate the folder related to data of dislocation microstructure [here](/data/)
    * [Dislocation microstructure of nickel material](/data/modelib-microstructure/modelib-nickel-microstructure.ttl) is the simulation data of dislocation microstructure of nickel (Ni) material generated by [MoDELib](https://github.com/giacomo-po/MoDELib)
* You may find a set of competence questions (CQs) along with SPARQL queries [here](/CQs/CQs.md).
* [RDF genererator](/python-script/) is the folder to locate python scripts that are used to generate rdf-data from the [data](/data/).
    * To generate the RDF graph from the given [data](/data/), we use the [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) python library.`
    * To generate the dislocation microstructure of nickel material, the script is in [here](/python-script/modelib/) and execute it with `python map_data.py`
* [crystal-structure-ontology](/crystal-structure-ontology) is a folder containing details of crystal structure ontology.
* [crystallographic-defect-ontology](/crystallographic-defect-ontology) is a folder containing details of crystallographic defect ontology.

## Usage
* We recommend to use [Protégé 5.5.0](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege) to be able to view and navigate classes and properties in DISO.
* We recommend also to use HermiT as a reasoner for DISO. You can select it through the menu *Reasoner* in Protégé software.
