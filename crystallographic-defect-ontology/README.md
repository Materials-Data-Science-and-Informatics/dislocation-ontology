### Crystallographic Defect Ontology

Crystallographic Defect Ontology (CDO) is an ontology connecting the physical materials entity to the crystal structure and several defectsin crystalline materials, e.g., point defect, dislocation, and grain boundary. In CDO, the `EMMO:Material` class isreused to describe the physical entity of crystalline materials. The `CDO:CrystallineMaterialclass` is subsequently a subclass `ofEMMO:Material`.
